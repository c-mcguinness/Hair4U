		<h1> Congratulations! You have Type 1 Hair!</h1>
	<p>•	Type 1A is straight as a pin, soft, shiny, a bit wispy, and doesn’t hold curls well.</p>
	<p> <img src="type1a.jpg" alt="type2"></p>
	<p>•	Type 1B is mostly straight, but with more body than type 1A.</p>
	<p> <img src="type1b.jpg" alt="type2"></p>
	<p>•	Type 1C is generally straight, but with body and a bit of bend.</p>
	<p> <img src="type1c.jpg" alt="type2"></p>
	<p>Type 1A hair is the least common, but any type 1 hair can cause a love-hate relationship. It’s soft to the touch and frizz-free, but also stubborn and hard to handle. The shine of type 1 hair is a definite bonus. That beautiful glow is thanks to how easily natural oils from your scalp can move down each straight hair shaft. The downside is that those oils build up, leaving you with greasy hair, a lack of volume, and a constant battle.</p>

				<h4>Dandruff Tips</h4>
					<p>Based on your results, it is evident that you suffer from dandruff and an irritated scalp. Dont worry we have just the right solution for you!</p>
					<p> Products with pyrithizone zinc are popular for treating dandruff because it contains anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. It’s also recommended to use coal-based shampoos (to slow down the growth of skin cells), selenium sulfide shampoos (to slow skin cell growth and reduce malassezia), and salicylic acid (to exfoliate the scalp).</p>
					<p> Since no one hair solution will immediately cure your dandruff, it's smart to switch things up every once in a while, to keep your flakes at bay. It’s good to rotate between different ingredients and not use the same all the time otherwise you’ll build up a tolerance to the ingredient."</p>
					<p>While you may need to experiment with different shampoos to find the perfect match, these are popular products to help with the milder cases of dandruff.</p>

					<h4>Tips for Growth &  Strength</h4>
						<p>Based on your results, it is evident that you would like to grow out your hair. We have the best solution for you and that involves taking hair growth supplements! Don't worry all the products and details are outlined below.</p>
						<p>Bioton</p>
						<p> <img src="biotin.jpg" width="200" height="200" ></p>
						<p>This B vitamin is an ingredient in many different hair supplements—for good reason. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that supports the growth of hair, skin, and nails by helping to break down fats and carbohydrates. Run low and you may notice your hair is weak, or you may start to lose it. </p>
						<p>You can expect the vitamin to increase the speed of hair growth, but it won’t increase thickness. However, it is far cheaper than other supplements, making it a good starting point. For one good biotin supplement.</p>
						<p> Viviscal Extra Strength Dietary Supplements</p>
						<p><img src="vivi.jpg" width="200" height="200" ></p>
						<p>Containing a marine complex, as well as biotin, zinc, vitamin C, iron, and horsetail extract, Viviscal “uses vitamins to extend the anagen (growth) phase of the hair growth cycle,” says Dr. Engelman. In a 2015 study published in Dermatology Research and Practice found that after 90 days, adult women taking Viviscal had an increase in hair volume and lost significantly fewer hairs after washing compared to a placebo.</p>

								<h4>Tips for Frizz Control</h4>
									<p>Frizz can happen to straight hair if it’s dry or damaged from too much heat-styling, bleaching, and dyeing. Chemical processing and heat-styling burn the hair’s cuticle, causing your would-be sleek locks to appear puffy, kinky, even straw-like. Too much friction from brushing and vigorous towel-drying can also ruffle the cuticle, creating unsightly frizz.</p>
									<p>Infusium Repair and Renew Smoothing Serum</p>
									<p> <img src="infusium.jpg" width="200" height="200" ></p>
									<p>If you have damaged hair, this serum will do wonders for your locks. It claims to repair, restore and restructure your hair with powerful ingredients like argan oil and keratin which also eliminates frizz and protects hair against humidity.
										“As you can tell from the name, this product smooths frizz instantly while taming flyaways. I usually massage two to three drops on either wet or dry hair — it works on both — to keep frizz at bay,” said Johnny Lavoy, a Connecticut-based hairstylist.</p>

						<div class="splitEndsTips1">
							<h4>Tips for Split Ends</h4>
							<p>From your answers we determined you are struggling with Split Ends. We got all the tips and tricks you need !</p>
							<p>1.	Wet hair is vulnerable to damage, so it’s important to care for your tresses gently after shampooing and conditioning.
								Some people have a habit of rubbing their hair dry with a towel, but this can damage it. Frequent rubbing can cause hair breakage. It can also damage your hair cuticles, resulting in split ends or frizziness.
								Instead of rubbing your hair dry, blot it dry with a towel to avoid breakage and damage.</p>
							<p>2. Tangled hair, whether wet or dry, can be difficult to comb or brush. So always detangle your hair before drying, brushing, or styling.

							The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends using a wide-tooth comb. The wider tooth allows the comb to glide through your hair without damaging the ends or causing breakage.</p>
							<p>3. Your hair doesn’t need 100 brush strokes a day. That’s a myth. In fact, brushing your hair too much can cause damage, including breakage and split ends.

								Instead, only brush your hair to style it or make it look neater. Avoid pulling or tugging on your hair as you brush or comb it, and use a detangling product if you need to get rid of knots.</p>

	<h1> Congratulations! You have Type 2 Hair!</h1>
	<p>There are three main types of wavy hair. Type 2 is the “in-between” hair type. It’s not completely straight nor is it completely curly. It’s not too dry, nor is it too oily. You can tell if your hair is Type 2 by looking at the curl pattern.</p>
	<p>•	Type 2A is fine and thin with a loose S pattern, and it’s generally easy to manage.</p>
	<p> <img src="type2a.jpg"></p>
	<p>•	Type 2B is medium thickness with a more defined S shape, prone to frizz and harder to manage.</p>
	<p><img src="type2b.jpg"></p>
	<p>•	Type 2C is coarse and thick with a prominent S pattern, almost curly, and it’s difficult to style.</p>
	<p><img src="type2c.jpg"></p>
	<p>Type 2 hair is often frizzy, but it’s typically not overly oily or too dry. Naturally wavy hair curls in an S shape determined by the number of bonds formed between the keratin protein in the hair shaft. Understanding your hair type is the first step in figuring out the styles and products that are right for your hair.</p>
